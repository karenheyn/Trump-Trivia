## About building this game
The code for this game was written in about two days. in order to accomplish this, I started the building the game by working on javascript in logic. Once that was complete, I worked on adding CSS and HTML, and event listeners to make the game more interactive. 
I would like to tweak some things in the mobile version, but am overall satisfied with the outcome.
